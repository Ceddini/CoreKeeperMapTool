		answer: "<strong>No.</strong> The Map Tool workes entirely client-side, in your browser tab. No files are uploaded.

I do however use Google Analytics to figure out which browsers / devices and in what languages people are using.<br>For a slightly more technical answer, check <em>\"What information do you have access to?\"</em>"

		question: "What information do you have access to?",
		answer: "The only data I have access to is the nginx log and Google Analytics. This contains your basic ip address and the user-agent.<br>The user-agent contains information about what type of browser you use. Google Analytics gives me access to basic interactions with the site, device information and general location. Location is only used to figure out from which countries most people come from."
